It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human \\noperator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to re-evaluate \\nincorrect decisions.[15] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was \\nNilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[16] \\nInterest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in \\n1973.[17] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network \\nlearns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer \\nterminal.[18]', metadata={'source': 'data.pdf', 'page': 0})]"
